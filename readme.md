## Drum Kit Web App

The code selects all elements on the page with the class name "drum" and adds a click event listener to each of them. When a button is clicked, the function makeSound() is called with the button's innerHTML as an argument. This function uses a switch statement to determine which sound to play based on the key that was pressed, and then creates a new Audio object with the corresponding sound file and plays it.

In addition to the click event listener, the code also adds a keydown event listener to the entire document. When a key is pressed, the makeSound() function is called with the key that was pressed as an argument.

The buttonAnimation() function adds a class of "pressed" to the active button that was clicked or pressed. This creates a visual effect of the button being pressed down. The class is then removed after a 100ms delay using the setTimeout() method.

Overall, this code allows users to play drum sounds on a web page by clicking buttons or pressing keys, and provides a visual feedback when a button or key is pressed.
